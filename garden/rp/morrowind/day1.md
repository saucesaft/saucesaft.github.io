I arrived to this place called morrowind I think, I was liberated because the emperor ordered, which is somewhat strange for me. I thought because of my race i was going to spend all my life in jail, the imperials are known to be pretty racist to anyone except themselves.

I wrote some things and got my papers, this place seems pretty uncanny for me, there's something odd.

Anyway, i found this ring inside the place i got my papers in but found out it was from this guy called "Fargoth". He told me to talk to the shopkeeper because i gave him his ring back.

I need to go to Balmora but figured out it was a long walk to there, thankfully discovered the "silt striders", went to the one near me but found someone dead? He had like 200 coins, he seemed to be a tax collector. Anyway, I went back to report his body and i was told to find his killer. When asking around the place if they knew him, everybody thought he deserved it because, well, he was a tax collector. I pinpointed his girlfriend, Thavere Vedrano, in the lighthouse, she knew exactly who did that to him. She talked about how he was mad at "Foryn Gilnith", he didn't want to pay his taxes, which i think eventually led Foryn to kill him. She also mentioned a ring she gave to Processus, that Foryn must have.
