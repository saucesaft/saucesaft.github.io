So i went on and confronted this so called "Foryn", he inmediatly admitted but wasn't going to give himself up so easilly, he wanted to fight. I didn't want to kill anyone, i was new to this place, i don't want an assasin reputation, but since i was doing this for the empire, i thought maybe this was ok?

(Here's my little corner of opinions regarding the empire. I've never been a fan of the empire, mostly because of it's problematic way of controlling, racism and slavery. But i figured out maybe this was different in morrowind, altough, im keeping my distance, anything can change in any moment)
