brain dump of the ideas i have

<!-- more -->

use an actual kindle (KT4 model) as the screen
replace battery with something bigger
model a new case to fit this battery (and remove amazon's logo)
add a keyboard (mechanical?)
very mucho storage

^^ these are my ideas for it, my main inspiration it the *actual* "Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy" no the *book*. filling it with a wikipedia dump, the whole gutenberg library and what ever else fits.

\[when i make an actual sketch of this device it will be in here, for the moment just imagine a cool looking cyberdeck\]
