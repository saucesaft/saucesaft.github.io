hello my name is Eduardo, people call me Lalo, but im better know as saucesaft on the internet. Im from the north of MÃ©xico but most of my posts are in english to practice it (I'm also learning german so there may be some german posts in the future).


**Q&A**

#### why saucesaft?
- sauce [in english] = thick _liquid_ served with food, usually savory dishes, to add moistness and flavor.
- saft [in german] = the _liquid_ obtained from or present in fruit or vegetables.

i mixed the words because i thought "funny = (liquid + liquid)", so saucesaft was born.
