<p>this is not a guide, just my process, although if you have any question, feel free to contact me</p>
<h3>things i want to achieve with my kindle</h3>
<ul>
<li>spi interface to expand storage</li>
<li>remove amazon's gui frontend but leave the kernel intact</li>
</ul>
<p>(i could also apply the theseus boat approach and hack around some drivers based on <a href="https://github.com/vroland/epdiy">epdiy</a> and a raspberry pi pico but where's the fun in that?)</p>
<h3>storage expansion</h3>
<p>so i have made some investigation about this, my kindle model does not have an internal sd card port, just an emmc chip :( taking this into account, i have these options</p>
<ul>
<li>resolder the emmc chip for a &quot;larger&quot; one
<ul>
<li>this is not an option, i have no experience soldering BGA and although it has been done with other kindles, my model is relatively new so there are no documented cases of people doing it. (also it may simply not work because of firmware)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>internal usb port
<ul>
<li>not following this approach because these ports are rarely available and only on models with included 3G modems inside (mine does not)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SPI SD Card (this is the one)
<ul>
<li>The imx6 sololite (cpu of my kindle) has 4 SPI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>deamazonification</h3>
<p>TODO</p>
