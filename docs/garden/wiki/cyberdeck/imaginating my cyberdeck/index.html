<p>brain dump of the ideas i have</p>
<p>use an actual kindle (KT4 model) as the screen
replace battery with something bigger
model a new case to fit this battery (and remove amazon's logo)
add a keyboard (mechanical?)
very mucho storage</p>
<p>^^ these are my ideas for it, my main inspiration it the <em>actual</em> &quot;Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot; no the <em>book</em>. filling it with a wikipedia dump, the whole gutenberg library and what ever else fits.</p>
<p>[when i make an actual sketch of this device it will be in here, for the moment just imagine a cool looking cyberdeck]</p>
