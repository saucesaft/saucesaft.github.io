<p>im reading the book <em>crafting a compiler with c</em> by <em>Charles N. Fischer</em>. here are some notes from the book. quotation marks signify a direct text-grab from the book. i hope this notes could later become someting useful for me or someone else. All credit goes to him, im publishing this as notes, no a &quot;direct copy&quot; of the book. Graphs and everything are based on the ones included on the book. Please go buy the book if these notes were useful to you.</p>
<p>&quot;A compiler must perform two major tasks: analysis of the source program being compiled and synthesis of a machine-language program that when executed will correctly perform the activities described by that source program.&quot; - Fischer</p>

<p><em>Scanner</em> - Reads the input and generates tokens
<em>Parser</em> - Builds a syntax tree to drive semantic processing
<em>Semantic Routines</em> - Check semantics (correct variable types, etc) and generate IR code after.</p>
