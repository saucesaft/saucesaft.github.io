      <p>I arrived to this place called morrowind I think, I was liberated because the emperor ordered, which is somewhat strange for me. I thought because of my race i was going to spend all my life in jail, the imperials are known to be pretty racist to anyone except themselves.</p>
<p>I wrote some things and got my papers, this place seems pretty uncanny for me, there's something odd.</p>
<p>Anyway, i found this ring inside the place i got my papers in but found out it was from this guy called &quot;Fargoth&quot;. He told me to talk to the shopkeeper because i gave him his ring back.</p>
<p>I need to go to Balmora but figured out it was a long walk to there, thankfully discovered the &quot;silt striders&quot;, went to the one near me but found someone dead? He had like 200 coins, he seemed to be a tax collector. Anyway, I went back to report his body and i was told to find his killer. When asking around the place if they knew him, everybody thought he deserved it because, well, he was a tax collector. I pinpointed his girlfriend, Thavere Vedrano, in the lighthouse, she knew exactly who did that to him. She talked about how he was mad at &quot;Foryn Gilnith&quot;, he didn't want to pay his taxes, which i think eventually led Foryn to kill him. She also mentioned a ring she gave to Processus, that Foryn must have.</p>
